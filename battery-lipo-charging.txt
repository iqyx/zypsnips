19:03 < Ecco> Also, what would be the cheapest way to charge a single cell LiPo battery over USB?
19:07 < englishman> TP4056 or friends work fine
19:07 < englishman> theres more complicated shit like BQ24075
19:11 < BrainDamage> use a charge controller and you'll be fine

<Ecco> Guys, is there any reference design I could learn from that uses an STM32 powered by a lipo battery and that charges over USB?
<jpa-> Ecco: if you want something simple, see page 3 here  http://koti.kapsi.fi/jpa/stuff/other/uunimittari_rx.pdf
<lorenzo> Ecco: https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/MCP73831.pdf
<lorenzo> probably one of the simplest / lowest part count you can get

RT9480 is basically a powerbank in a chip, LiPo charger, boost converter, battery gague. Pretty cheap too, possibly repurposable.

BQ24600 is multi cell stepdown charger, good for up to 6 cells, no useless i2c etc. Quite a few external components etc, BUT datsheet example shows you everything you need, so if you have room its good to go.

MCP73871 is a cheap, handy charging/powering auto selecting power path.
