01:27 < dongs> so yesterday some fucking neighbor kids found my 0402 caps asmple book
01:28 < dongs> found them quietly sitting under my office desk, peeling pull tape off every fucking 
               cut tape
01:28 < dongs> and spilling caps on the floor


04:29 <aandrew> my (at the time) 3yo found wire cutters and decided to make a few of my USB devices wireless
04:29 <aandrew> I'm just happy that he didn't decide to cut into a power cable
04:32 <cjbaird> I had a fully tuned and matched dipole for 40 metres in the backyard, and a 16yo visiting next door didn't know what it was and pulled it down to look at it. Ignorant millenial cunt.
