tabs vs space is one thing, but jpa really knows how to find the path less trodden.

17:54 <dongs> keil configuration: save source files as utf8, enable white space display, set all tabs to spaces. nothign else to touch.
17:54 <qyx_> fukin tabs as spaces
17:54 <dongs> fuck tabs
17:54 <dongs> every jew has their own idea of what tabsize is
17:54 <qyx_> thats the feature
17:58 <jpa-> i indent first code level with \u2006, second with \u2005, third with \u2004 etc.
17:58 <jpa-> saves space compared to using multiple characters
18:12 <aandrew> dongs: whyt he fuck would you get rid of tabs
18:12 <aandrew> are you some kind of python apologist
18:13 <jpa-> because spaces are for people that want shit to just work
