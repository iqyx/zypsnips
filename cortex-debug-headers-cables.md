## ARM "standard" cortex debug
ARM made a new "standard" for cortex debug, because smaller is cooler y0. [Read their description of it here](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/attached/13634/cortex_debug_connectors.pdf)

The takeaway is, 2x5, in a _svelte_ 1.27mm pitch  
The common older style is 2x10, but in fatduino 2.54mm pitch.

## Cables

## Adapters
Helping clutter your desk and let you use two of your existing cables,
for ultimate bigmessowires style.

Like above, but with "moah fr33d0M" and now supporting windows!

## Board headers

### esden's choice: FTSH-105-01-L-DV-K   (SMT)
not super cheap, (he gets from samtec directly) but it has partial 
shrouding, only around the pins where the key on the cable goes, so it
takes up a lot less space. 
[Digikey partnumber SAM8799-ND](Or just http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?keywords=SAM8799-ND)

### aandrew's choice: (and other people)
< aandrew> I use the standard everyday fucking used everywhere digikey 1175-1629-nd

* [Digikey 1175-1629-ND (smt)](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?keywords=1175-1629-ND)
* [Digikey 1175-1627-ND (pth)](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?keywords=1175-1627-ND)

Much much much cheaper, but fully fully shrouded, so more board space.

### englishman's choice: (shrouds and keys are for l0sers)

Note, this is actually _more_ expensive than the shrouded version above.

[Digikey 609-3729-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/amphenol-fci/20021121-00010T4LF/609-3729-ND/2209075)

### englishman's choice2: (shrouds appear to actually be useful)
Right angle, shrouded.  For that low profile look.

## Proprietary shit

Some people occasionally espouse the virtues of tag-connect.  They are wrong.

< aandrew> 
> it looks great on paper and if you don't need retention clips (i.e. you aren't oing to be debugging
> with it or flashing 2GB flash via JTAG) it's actually not half bad for press down, flash, done
> but the second you need it to stay there you are drilling four gigantic fucking holes which

> starts bending and it no longer holds, so you resort to wrapping the thing to the board with 30AWG
> like a spider wraps a fly. which works until you need to take it off
> 
> it's just fail

> you want to do debugging? gotta drill those fucking HUGE holes for retention 
> or use the clip on the bottom which works its way loose
> you want tiny footprint? use a fucking bed of nails and 4 test points. way smaller
> want to be frou-frou and have spring contacts on the cheap? Use something like isptouch for *way* cheaper

(much later, someone though this was arrogant legacy thinking.... and then...)
