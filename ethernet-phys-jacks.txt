Jacks:
qyx: RJHSE-338X (Amphenol)
    x = 0 (no leds) x = something else, different led colours

01:35 < gxti> you can get compatible ones from china if you're super cheap
01:35 < dongs> HR911105A
01:35 < dongs> they're fucking everywehre
01:36 < gxti> they're in ur beagleboner


PHYs:
qyx: ksz8031rnl (Micrel) (small, cheap, nice)
    (This is EOL, micrel reccommends KSZ8081RNx replacement)
    (8091 is the same, with WakeOnLan and energy saving ethernet stuff)
qyx also approves of 8051, fwiw.
zyp: ksz8081rnaca

dongs: DP83848 (TI, ex natsemi)

Other people have used the SMSC LAN8720A, but...
03:11 < zyp> shame the phy doesn't have cable test functions
03:11 < emeb> yeah, it's got a loopback, but that's all
03:11 < zyp> the micrel phy got some fancy reflectometry function for testing the cable
03:12 < emeb> nice
03:12 < emeb> and it's got a lower BOM - fewer passives IIRC
however:
dongs sez the lan8720 is readily available for ch33p in china, and
claims only the usual bypass caps and 12.k RBIAS and that's it. sooo, perhaps emeb
wasn't remembering correctly that day?

Also, for phys, and also wrt to cheaping out on a lan8720a, and not using two crystals:
3:58 <Thorn> dongs: LL_RCC_ConfigMCO(LL_RCC_MCO2SOURCE_HSE, LL_RCC_MCO2_DIV_1);
13:58 <Thorn> 25 MHz HSE -> mco -> phy -> refclk -> mac
14:13 <dongs> right
14:13 <dongs> good shit
14:13 <dongs> you've saved $0.20
14:13 <dongs> we should file this under zypsnips
14:14 <dongs> karlp: ^ last 2 Thorn lines, under "ethernet_phy_no_crystal.txt"
14:16 <Thorn> section 3.7.4.2 REF_CLK Out Mode and fig. 3.9 in the datasheet
14:17 <Thorn> which doesn't show the pulldown on LED2/nINTSEL which you need to enable this mode
14:18 <Thorn> also sections 3.7.4 and 3.8.1.2
14:19 <Thorn> fig 3.11 in 3.8.1.2 shows the resistor


MACs:
no, we aint recommending no 10meg spi mac+phy combos numbnuts.
