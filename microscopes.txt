Mantis? Everybody wants one, no-one has one.

But what are they for? well... things change after you have one...

03:00 < jadew> I was able to do some amazing rework with it
03:00 < jadew> no to mention some mechanical stuff that I wouldn't have dreamt of doing
03:03 < jadew> in the first day I got it I told my wife to come quick cuz I found some hidden inscriptions on our coins
03:03 < jadew> I was able to write in the O in ROMANI on a coin like this one:

03:03 < jadew> the message was "Blowjob?" (only 4 letters in romanian :P)
03:04 < jadew> the answer was no...

6:51 <jpa-> karlp: not sure if it appears as USB device at all, it has hdmi out and usb for power; that video i recorded on SD card while watching on the small screen
16:51 <jpa-> Steffanx: more like babbys first bga stress
16:52 <jpa-> karlp: yeah, the gold ring rotates for focus
16:53 <jpa-> karlp: it's an ok microscope and image quality on external HDMI display is great, but it's kind of shame that the built-in display has 320x240 px resolution only - one would think there would be some higher resolution mobile phone displays available
6:53 <karlp> jpa-: the pics imply it has a usb-mini-b port ont he screen s well? is that the power one? I thought from the pics it was powered by a usb cable to the base?
16:54 <jpa-> karlp: yeah, it came with two cables, the base one only powers the leds
16:54 <jpa-> i've modded mine so that there is usb connector in the base so that i can connect the screen to that
16:55 <jpa-> (the screen/microscope part can be taken out and used with any kind of base)
