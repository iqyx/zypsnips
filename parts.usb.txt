Micro USB connectors:
This is the channel recommended, combo PTH+SMD, for as rugged as you can get
http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/10103594-0001LF/609-4050-1-ND/2350357

Note it does have slots, so it's not for every cheap fab house, and it's not
necessarily easy for home soldering, but it's solid.

06:47 < dongs> microusb is the stuff me + zyp use
06:47 < dongs> fci
06:47 < dongs> 10103594-0001LF
06:48 < zyp> it's not AB, it's B

16:01 < aandrew> dongs: thanks again for that usb micro connector part number that doesn't suck. I 
                 love these little things, although I still hate the connector itself
or, as was rephrased:
16:12 < aandrew> MOAR ANCHOR


I can't find another source of these, but they are also "moar anchor" and the
ebay link has been working since at least when I copied it off a blog dated
May June 2016

USB-C is teh futahhh!

03:57 <dongs> chinese USB-C socket without highspeed lanes delivers
03:57 <dongs> good quality, and works as advertised

04:03 <salcedo> what is it
04:06 <dongs> a usb-c connector
04:06 <dongs> on a pcb
04:06 <dongs> takes up about as much space as microusb and my stuff is in 2019
04:06 <dongs> instead of 2009
04:07 <salcedo> usb-c is 2019? say waaaa?
04:07 <dongs> yeah, waht USB socket are YOU placing on your boards in 2019?
04:08 <salcedo> just made a usb-a pads on pcb footprint
04:09 <salcedo> to plug the pcb right into the usb port
04:09 <dongs> disgusting but has its purpose
04:09 <salcedo> i don't see type A going anywhere soon
04:30 <Thorn> dongs: what chip did you use for pd?
04:38 <dongs> hmm? no PD on here
04:38 <dongs> just 5.1K to ground on both CCs
04:38 <dongs> my shit is a sink, not source (in this board)
04:38 <dongs> so i dont realyl carea bout PD negotiation too much
05:42 <invzim> Cracki: jadew thanks for input regarding enclosure
05:46 <invzim> dongs: got part#/source for that usb-c?
05:48 <invzim> still have no usb-c stuff in my house, but guess it's the future of things..
05:49 <dongs> invzim: chiense thing. sec
05:49 <dongs> U262-16XN-4BVC11
05:51 <dongs> i also emailed sales@xkb and got a 3d model for it in like 10 minsd
05:53 <dongs> its on LCSC, tons of stock elsewhere in china etc.
05:54 <dongs> a good part if you wanna do PD because it has everyting except 4 highspeed lanes
05:54 <dongs> so it has cc, sbu, usb2 and vbus/gnd

05:56 <invzim> would be this one I guess?
05:57 <invzim> yah
05:59 <invzim> seems like a ton of gotchas with usb-c, when even rpi4 got it wrong
