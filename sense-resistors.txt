12:06 < jpa-> if more than 1 mohm, just put it in your pad layout and it'll be fine
12:07 < kakimir> put what where?

12:08 < jpa-> http://www.ti.com/ods/images/SNVS829C/30191552.png   even just this works pretty well
12:08 < dongs> nice
12:08 < dongs> fake pattern?
12:08 < dongs> or rather, shunt pattern and then just draw traces from under it?
12:08 < kakimir> hmm
12:08 < jpa-> dongs: yeah
12:08 < kakimir> interestings
12:08 < dongs> pro
12:09 < kakimir> how about those shunts with seperate pads for sense?
12:10 < dongs> i can understand why you dont wanna make footprints
12:10 < dongs> cuz its so hard to do in kikecad
12:10 < kakimir> I said nothing about that
12:10 < jpa-> they are nice if you need high accuracy low shunts without needing to calibrate; but at that point you usually don't mind it costing a bit extra
