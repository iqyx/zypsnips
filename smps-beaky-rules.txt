Build your own SMPS using a mcu?

05:16 <PeterM> i dunno the obsession with mcu controlled dc-dc
05:17 <dongs> SAVE COSTS
05:18 <PeterM> 0/10
05:19 <englishman> increase costs
05:19 <englishman> AND complexity
05:19 <englishman> those guys at TI and LT have NO idea what they are doing!
05:19 <PeterM> increase dev time, increase dev costs, reduce reliability
05:19 <dongs> yep thats the spirit
05:19 <PeterM> sounds like a plan
05:19 <dongs> fuck those big name guys
05:20 <dongs> they are dumb
05:20 <dongs> i will save money wiht stm32



So, you've got ripple on your smps?  And you're scoping it how?
(Oh, you do know about capacitor derating on dc bias right?)

Let our resident definitely not a russian advise you....

01:38 < R2COM> what caps on in and out and what inductor?
01:38 < R2COM> what is part # for that cap?
01:39 < R2COM> whats its DC rating?
01:41 < R2COM> @ 5V for that specific cap, you have according to datasheet characteristics -60% 
               Capacitance
01:41 < R2COM> thats first big fault
01:41 < R2COM> another thing is
01:41 < R2COM> how do you actually MEASURE it?
01:41 < R2COM> how do you connect scope probe to it?
01:41 < R2COM> i mean
01:41 < R2COM> in what mode scope input is configured?
01:42 < dongs> just normal capture. and i tried both long gnd lead and short test clip, its ~same
01:42 < R2COM> DC or AC input?
01:42 < dongs> should be dc
01:42 < R2COM> wrong
01:42 < R2COM> must use AC input
01:42 < R2COM> did you also BW limited the channel?
01:43 < dongs> no and no
01:43 < R2COM> so: wrong measurement
01:44 < R2COM> configure scope to AC input, BW to 20MHz limit, then turn off your circuit, connect 
               probe to where you measuring it, and select number of averages so that you see <<1mV 
               ripple
01:44 < R2COM> then turn on circuit
01:44 < R2COM> that would be proper measurement
